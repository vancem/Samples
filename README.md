# Samples

This respository is a set of odds and end examples that I wish to publish publically.

Here are some links to display the HTML files in this repository.  

  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/animation.html - a very simple annimation (a ball moving in a box)
  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/mouse.html - a pong-like game that uses the mouse
  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/mouseWithBeeps.html - same as mouse.html but with sound
  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/bouncingBalls.html - a simulation of many balls bouncing in a box.  
  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/calculator.html - a simple 4 function calculator.  

The above is not a complete list of links for HTML file in this repo, but these links are automatically generated, so they exist 
for every file automatically.   Basically it is http://vancem.github.io/Samples followed by the relative path in this repo.   

If for whatever reasons these links do not work you can also download and run the file locally on your computer.   To do this
   * click on the link in github associated with the HTML file you wish to run.
   * right click on the 'Raw' button (right side near the top) and select 'Save link as' and then select 
     a file name for the downloaded file.  Typically the defaults are OK (will be named the same as in the repo)
   * then open file explorer for the directory where you downloaded it and double click on it to launch it in a browser.  

To see the code or to debug it you can open up the dev-tools in the browser (Ctrl-Shift-C) and then select the 'Source' tab.  If
you are using the Chrome browser you can learn more about the dev-tools at https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools.
