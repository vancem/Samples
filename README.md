# Samples

This respository is a set of odds and end examples that I wish to publish publically.

Here are some links to display the HTML files in this repository.  

  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/animation.html - a very simple annimation (a ball moving in a box)
  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/mouse.html - a pong-like game that uses the mouse
  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/mouseWithBeeps.html - same as mouse.html but with sound
  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/bouncingBalls.html - a simulation of many balls bouncing in a box.  
  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/calculator.html - a simple 4 function calculator.  
  * http://vancem.github.io/Samples/Simon.html - The 'simon' says memory game. 

To see the code or to debug it you can open up the dev-tools in the browser (Ctrl-Shift-C) and then select the 'Source' tab.   
You can edit the HTML in Github directly commit it, and then refresh the brower to run the updated code.
